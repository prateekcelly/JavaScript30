      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      //   const human = person;
      //   human.age = 99;
      //   console.log(human, person);

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const human3 = { ...person };

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      //   const newObject = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object));
